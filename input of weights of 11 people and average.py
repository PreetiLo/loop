# Take input of weights of 11 people and then print their average and 
# then check whether the average weight is a multiple of 5 or not? 
# This means that when you will divide the average weight by 5, the remainder should be 0.
# Note :-Here you have to use input function. You can also use raw input to take 
# the weights as inputs, inside the loop.

# n=int(input("enter  the any number"))
# i=0
# total=0
# while i<=n:
#     inp_weights=int(input("Enter your weight : "))
#     total+=inp_weights
#     i+=1
# avr=total/n
# print(avr)
# if avr%5==0:
#     print("The average weight is a multiple of 5 ")
# else:
#     print("The average weight is not a multiple of 5 ")
